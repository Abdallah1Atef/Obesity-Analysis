# CSV Data Mining and Analysis
This project demonstrates data mining and exploratory data analysis techniques on a CSV dataset, The objective of this project is to extract insights and patterns from a dataset using Python data mining techniques, using libraries like pandas, matplot, seaborn, sklearn. 

This repository contains a project focused on data mining techniques used to analyze a dataset in CSV format. The project involves importing, cleaning, and performing exploratory data analysis on the dataset.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to demonstrate how to analyze a dataset using data mining techniques. The data is imported from a CSV file, cleaned, and then processed to extract valuable insights.

### Key Steps in the Project:

1. **Data Import**: Load the CSV file into the environment using Python (e.g., `pandas`).
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, correct data types, and remove duplicates.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
   - Visualize and summarize key features of the data.
   - Compute descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, etc.).
   - Analyze data distributions and trends.
4. **Data Mining Techniques**: 
   - Apply clustering, classification, or regression techniques as applicable.
   - Extract insights and patterns from the dataset.
5. Results and Insights: Summarize findings and provide any conclusions drawn from the analysis.

## Dataset
The data consist of the estimation of obesity levels in people from the countries of Mexico, Peru and Colombia,
With ages between 14 and 61 and diverse eating habits and physical condition,
Data was collected using a web platform with a survey where anonymous users answered each question,
Then the information was processed obtaining 17 attributes and 2111 records.

###The attributes related with eating habits are: 
1.Frequent consumption of high caloric food (FAVC)
2.Frequency of consumption of vegetables (FCVC)
3.Number of main meals (NCP)
4.Consumption of food between meals (CAEC)
5.Consumption of water daily (CH20)
6.Consumption of alcohol (CALC)
###The attributes related with the physical condition are:
1.Calories consumption monitoring (SCC)
2.Physical activity frequency (FAF)
3.Time using technology devices (TUE)
4.Transportation used (MTRANS)
## Tools and Technologies

##- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries Used:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` and `scikit-learn`  for data visualization
